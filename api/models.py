Pydantic Models for API Request/Response Schemas

This module defines all the data models used for API request and response schemas.
It includes models for workflows, executions, file operations, and error handling.

Key Models:
    - WorkflowCreateRequest: For creating new workflows
    - WorkflowExecuteRequest: For executing workflows with user input
    - WorkflowResponse: Standard workflow response format
    - WorkflowExecutionResponse: Execution result format
    - File-related models: For file upload/management operations
    - Error models: Standard error response format

Features:
    - Pydantic validation and serialization
    - Type hints and field descriptions
    - Enum-based status management
    - DateTime handling with proper formatting
